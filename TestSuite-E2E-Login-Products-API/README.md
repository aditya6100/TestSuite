# TestSuite – End-to-End Testing for Sample Login & Products API

This repository contains a sample testing project for a fictional "Login & Products API". It is designed to be an intermediate-level portfolio project for QA engineers.

## Project Summary

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to API testing, covering the entire testing lifecycle from planning to automation. It includes:

- **Test Plan:** A formal document outlining the testing strategy.
- **Test Cases:** Detailed test cases for manual execution.
- **Bug Reports:** Examples of how to report bugs found during testing.
- **Postman Collection:** A ready-to-use Postman collection for manual and exploratory testing.
- **Automation Scripts:** A basic API automation suite using Node.js, Jest, and Supertest.

## How a Fresher QA Can Use This as a Portfolio

This project is an excellent way for a fresher QA engineer to showcase their skills. Here’s how you can use it:

1.  **Understand the fundamentals:** Study the test plan and test cases to understand the thought process behind testing an API.
2.  **Demonstrate practical skills:** Use the Postman collection to manually test the API. This shows you can use industry-standard tools.
3.  **Showcase automation capabilities:** The Jest and Supertest script demonstrates your ability to write code and automate tests.
4.  **Explain your work:** During an interview, you can walk through the different parts of this project to explain the testing lifecycle and your role in it.
5.  **Build on it:** Use this project as a base to add more complex tests and features.

## How to Extend Test Cases

The current set of test cases is a good starting point, but it can be extended in many ways. Here are some ideas:

-   **More Negative Tests:**
    -   Test with different data types (e.g., send a string for a price).
    -   Test boundary conditions (e.g., very long strings, zero price).
    -   Test for SQL injection or other common security vulnerabilities.
-   **Performance Tests:**
    -   Use tools like JMeter or k6 to write basic performance tests.
    -   Measure response times under different loads.
-   **Schema Validation:**
    -   Add tests to validate the API response schema (e.g., using `chai-json-schema` with your Jest tests).
-   **Integration Scenarios:**
    -   Create more complex tests that involve multiple API calls. For example:
        1.  Create a product.
        2.  Update the product.
        3.  Verify the update.
        4.  Delete the product (if a `DELETE` endpoint is added).
